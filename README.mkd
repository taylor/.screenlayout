These scripts are for setting up displays in various ways.  You could easily have one called from ~/.xinitrc or whatever.

I run ~/.screenlayout/laptop-only.sh when unplugging from external displays.

They could all be tied into the plugdev stuff for automation.

I am not calling disper from the scripts but instead just type ```disper -e``` manually.

I recommend lxrandr as backup (or for generating similar script files).
